# SBL Score Board

```
git clone
npm i
nmp start
```

I was running into cors issues with the endpoint given to me.

So I am running a proxy on heroku cloned from https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere.

It seems like the service goes down for a couple minutes sometimes so if it is not fetching the data waiting a little bit may work.

Thank you!
